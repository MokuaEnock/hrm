# Design guidelines

The following are the guidelines to be followed when using measurements in styling components and HTML elements:

- The root width of the component should use the `VW` measurement and child elements should use the percentage
- The root height of the component should use `VH` measurement and child elements should use percentage
- The font size of:
  - Paragraphs - use `1rem`
  - Sub-headings `1.3rem`
  - Headings `1.6rem`

Consider using flex for display before using Grid or any other alternative.
